### To do / Ideas

- Mark down previewer
- Mark down format (prettier)
- Write without formatting
- Closing last buffer should open neo-tree
- Can we avoid empty buffers?
- Rust support
- Support for html, js, ts, svelte
- Delete a buffer by number (i.e. a buffer that is currently not the one we have open)
- Better diagnostics. Squiqqly lines - easier way to show under the cursor, etc.
- Search and replace in multiple files (grug-far maybe?)
- Sessions?
- Dashboard?
- Git status within bufferline?
- Shortcut(s) to move buffer into ordinal position. E.g. <leader>bm1 should move the buffer to the ordinal position 1.
- Git blame on a given line.
- A way to see git blame on a change.
- Lazygit within neovim?
- Tmux theme same as tokyonight?
- Find out how we can "refactor"/"rename" a variable or function name
- Do we need treesitter? Do we already have treesitter?
